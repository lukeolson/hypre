Compile hypre as usual.  The variable nongalerk_type can now be set with:
     HYPRE_BoomerAMGSetNonGalerkType( HYPRE_Solver solver, HYPRE_Int nongalerk_type );

   The value of nongalerk_type yields the following:
        0 - Original NonGalerkin
        1 - Sparse Galerkin (with full lumping)
        2 - Hybrid Galerkin (with full lumping)
        3 - Diagonally-Lumped Sparse Galerkin
        4 - Diagonally-Lumped Hybrid Galerkin
