Compile hypre as usual without FEI (--without-fei).  The following variables are now available to be set:

    1. nongalerk_type:
        HYPRE_BoomerAMGSetNonGalerkType(HYPRE_Solver solver, HYPRE_Int nongalerk_type)

        0 - Original NonGalerkin
        1 - Sparse Galerkin (Full Lumping)
        2 - Hybrid Galerkin (Full Lumping)
        3 - Diagonally-Lumped Sparse Galerkin
        4 - Diagonally-Lumped Hybrid Galerkin

    2. adaptive:
        HYPRE_PCGSetAdaptive(HYPRE_Solver solver, HYPRE_Int adaptive)

        0 - regular PCG solve
        1 - adaptive PCG solve

    3. nongalerk_new_tol
        HYPRE_BoomerAMGSetNonGalerkNewTol(HYPRE_Solver solver,
                HYPRE_Int nongalerk_new_num_tol, HYPRE_Real *nongalerk_new_tol)

        Sets a list of drop tolerances to adapt to.  If entries are added back,
        the next drop tolerance in this list is selected to be the new drop tolerance
        at this level.


    4. nongalerk_num_updates
        HYPRE_BoomerAMGSetNonGalerkNumUpdates(HYPRE_Solver solver,
                HYPRE_Int nongalerk_num_updates)

        Sets the number of levels to be updated during one solve adaptation.

    5. update_rate
        HYPRE_PCGSetUpdateRate(HYPRE_Solver solver, HYPRE_Int update_rate)

        Sets the minimum number of iterations the krylov solver must run before
        entries are added back to the hierarchy.

    6. conv_tol
        HYPRE_PCGSetConvTol(HYPRE_Solver solver, HYPRE_Real conv_tol)

        Sets a tolerance for the convergence factor.  Entries are added back to
        the hierarchy only if the convergence factor is higher than this tolerance.


NOTES:
    - Adaptive solve only works with diagonally-lumped sparse/hybrid Galerkin
        -nongalerk_type must be 3 or 4
    - Adaptive solve is only implemented for PCG
        - if any other solver is used, nothing will update during the solve
